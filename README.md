# K--Nearest-Neighbor-
I have used MATLABâ€™s importdata function to load X_test, X_train, Y_test and Y_train. KNN model with k=7 is trained with help of fitcknn Function.  fitcknn function  takes X_train , Y_train, NumNeighbors and 7 as input. Here X_train is target input for the model, Y_train is target output for the model and 7 will the value of k which will be assigned to NumNeighbors.  By default Euclidian is used to calculate nearest neighbors.  Once the model is trained for training data it is tested against test data X_test. 

X-test and X_train are pretty big files and I havent uploaded. You can try this with your own data set.
